# MDS-ML-Exoplanets

This repository contain 3 pieces of code:
 - Exoplanets.ipynb
 - NN-model.py
 - exoplanets.py

The first is a jupyter notebook that shows the steps that were followed in the data exploration and preprocessing stages. It also includes the tests that were made in order to select the best performing model for the Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and SVM.
The second script contains the NN model that we have designed.
The third script is a collection of functions that we have developed during the course of the project that have been exported to a separate module for practical reason.

The project report can be found in the pdf file. 

To reproduce the results one will need to download that dataset from Kaggel (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/exoplanets), make sure that all needed libraries are installed, and execute the jupyter notebook.
Finally to reproduce the NN results the NN-model.py script should be executed.
